## Password Generator

This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Password generator loops through multiple arrays: 
- Numbers
- Alphabet letters
- Special characters

User can select an option for a password between 8-128 characters that may contain any of the optional arrays. 

The loop function evaluates the userChoice conditions as it passes through the loop, checking for true statements. The while loop was used because we wanted the result to add to the existing characters, creating the password length selected. Otherwise, with a for loop, the results were being multiplied and creating very long passwords.
